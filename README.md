# Terraform-IaC_


Created a scalable and modular infrastructure on AWS.
âœ… Deployed an EC2 instance to host a fully provisioned web server.
âœ… Configured Terraform state management to store the statefile securely in AWS S3.
âœ… Followed best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure maintainability and collaboration.

#ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:

Leveraged Terraform to simplify deployment and improve efficiency.
Enabled seamless collaboration by using an S3 backend for Terraform state.
Automated web server provisioning, saving time and effort.
This project gave me hands-on experience with cloud automation, Terraform state management, and AWS services like EC2 and S3. Itâ€™s amazing to see how tools like Terraform make infrastructure provisioning more efficient and scalable.
